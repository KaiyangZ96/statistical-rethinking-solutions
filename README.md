Solutions of practice problems from the Richard McElreath's ["Statistical Rethinking" book](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/).

These solutions were not checked by anybody, so please let me know if you find any errors.

### Alternatives
Alternative solutions can be found at https://github.com/cavaunpeu/statistical-rethinking

Differences with mentioned repo:

* Solutions were added for problems 11H5, 12H2, 12H3, 13H3, 13H4, 14H2, 14H3
* Solutions for all easy problems were added starting from chapter 6.
* More extensive visualisations of hard problems were added, when possible.

### Possible issues
If you encounter `Couldn't coerce S4 object to double` error while plotting inference results try to use recommendations from the discussion https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/issues/22. If none of them helps, uncomment `source("plot_bindings.R")` line at the beginning of the scripts.
